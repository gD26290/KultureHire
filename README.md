#WOW2022 W28: Can you build a butterfly chart?

Requirements
> Dashboard Size: 800 x 700px
> 1 sheet
> Create a butterfly chart showing Male and Female population for 2021
> Add context to show the total population
> Format tooltips and axis the same
> You can do this two ways. Ideally this challenge is focusing on LODs. To need the LOD you need to pivot the data so it has a row per Gender per year. Then we can just keep 2021.
